# CO2509 Assignment: Weather Application

An android app using Flutter aimed at showing the weather and forecast of user seleted cities.

## Introduction

This project is a basic weather app created that can show the current weather of a given city.
It allows you to add cities, as well as set certain cities as favourites, at which point they will also show in a seperate list.
Due to API limitations, only the current weather of a given city can be displayed. No weather forecasts will be displayed.

## Getting Started

If building the app for the first time, run the following batch files in this order:

- cleanproj.bat
- getpkg.bat
- buildapp.bat

The assembled APK can be found in "\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk", and will be called "app-release.apk".

# CO2509 Assignment: Weather Application

An android app using Flutter aimed at showing the weather and forecast of user seleted cities.

## Introduction

This project is a basic weather app created that can show the current weather of a given city.
It allows you to add cities, as well as set certain cities as favourites, at which point they will also show in a seperate list.
Due to API limitations, only the current weather of a given city can be displayed. No weather forecasts will be displayed.

## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT: Before building, ensure you have Flutter version 2.10.3 installed. Older versions may not work.**

If building the app for the first time, run the following batch files in this order:

- cleanproj.bat
- getpkg.bat
- buildapp.bat

It is also possible to do the same thing in Visual Studio Code, provided you have the project folder open in a workspace:

In the terminal, type the command "flutter clean" without quotes to completely clean the project.
Next, type the command "flutter pub get" also without quotes to acquire the necessary packages.
Finally, type the command "flutter build apk" also without quotes to build the project.

The assembled APK can be found in "\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk", and will be called "app-release.apk".

When downloading the ZIP, the project should have already had cleanproj.bat run already, so all you need to do is download the necessary
packages, and build the project.
